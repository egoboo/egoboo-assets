BUGS
- Mouse pointer disappears after starting a game
- Not all tiles get drawn properly if you zoom the camera in max (sometimes this also happens with minimum zoom as well)
- Twice there was a crash bug (playing Elf Starter) caused by cone_intersects_point() where the return value was max negative 64-bit integer (-858993460)
  Note: This bug happened again. This time it returned 39803748
  Note: This also happened in Paladin Starter (retval = 19195920)
  Function should only return type geometry_rv but seems to return seemingly random other values
- Billboards are drawn upside-down!
- Rotating the camera does not work
- Swinging a weapon in right hand will cause your character to move slightly. I am un-sure if this is intended.
- There is no darkness in modules
- I cant pick up money
- Water pool in Soldier Starter is not drawn
- Sounds seem to carry too far. I can hear stuff on the other side of the map (sometimes very loud)
- The enemy riding the chocobone in Soldier starter seems only to ride around me in circles
- Tranches popping out of chests and broken idols are flinged outside the map
- Lumpkin blood seems to take very long time to disappear
- The camera in G'nome starter does not swing
- Camera movements become choppy if you move close to the edges
- Something is wrong with the AI turning code. AI are not properly facing their opponents (Vikings in Valkyrie Starter). Possible SetTurnModeToWatchTarget ?
- Whips do not uncoil when they attack
- Blips on the minimap no longer work
- Sneaking does not work
- Potions are so bright they are completely white (you cannot see the potion contents like red liquid)
- Longbows in the hands of Cobols no longer spawn (Rogue Starter)
- The chained ball in Rogue Starter suddenly duplicated when I grabbed it. I have 2 chains attached to my leg now!

All these modules have Water (related?):
- Performance problems in Elf Starter (~10 fps, ~25 ups, update lag: ~5)
- Performance problems in Wizard Starter as well
- Performance problems in Valkyrie Starter

Related particle bump bugs:
- Ghouls do not hurt you with their melee attack (Healer Starter)
- It also seems that all foes are more difficult to hit, as direct contact seems not to work.
- It is almost impossible to get injured by ghouls. Sometimes jumping during their attacks can cause injury, however. (HOLY damage works OK)
- Frights are not hurt by HOLY magic
- Attack particle when attacking with a Claw spawns in the wrong hand

Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

UNCONFIRMED:
2. The Paladin module seems to be missing the items it needs to be completed; neither the first or second rooms of the sarcophaguses contain keys!
11. Rug mimics are very hard to find because they are usually invisible unless they are attacking.
12. The cursor is not displayïng correctly in specific texture filtering modes

KNOWN BUGS:
- The hints seem to be ‘cut’ off my screen, perhaps due to the font size, or my resolution.
- Sometimes the avatars in the playër select will turn into books. Could any of you guess why that might be happening?
- Can't use command keys for input controls (shift ctrl, etc.)
- Tourist: one of the keys ( at platforms) always fell trough the platform to the pit. that makes this level unbeatable. 
- "items falls through the floor" bug
- Redo some of the Devil Door stuff (detect dead)
- Trigger Tiles move through players.
- Xbows and Longbows have horrible attack range as the arrows hit ground too early
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
- Sometimes “Immune” pops up when idols are attacked. I find this misleading, as idols could still be destroyed with the same weapon used previously.
- Starting equipment is not properly unkursed
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- Need magic sparks for the sporks attacks.
- Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice.

WISHLIST:
- Add multiplayer networking
- MESHFX_WALL should become hillside and not impassable while MESH_FXSLIPPERY should become icy.
- Rework how identifying stuff works. Currently it doesn't work at all.
